<p>Well, dean gentle readers like General McArthur we have returned.
While we have gotten somewhat behind in schedule (?),
we hope that the somewhat altered appearance of this publication
has made the wait worth it.</p>

<p>Frankly, we are in need of high quality material 
for publication on these pages.
This is particularly true if we are to effectively 
communicate among ourselves and with others.</p>

<p>Anyone who has ever &ldquo;volunteered&rdquo; to produce
a newsletter can sympathize with both the tone and the form 
of this quotation.
Some typos leap off the page <i>after</i> you&rsquo;ve struggled
for days &mdash; alone and with few resources other than
your own time and commitment &mdash;
<i>and</i> the cussed thing has already been printed!
Being a volunteer editor is a lonely business, at best.</p>

<p>Newcomer to the APL community may not realize that
<i>APL Quote-Quad</i> predates the formation of any recognized
or &ldquo;organized&rdquo; APL user group in the computing
world at large.
In fact, <i>APL Quote-Quad</i> provided the first means 
of written communication for APL users outside of IBM,
and this homespun newsletter was definitely a germinal
element in the organization of APL users under the aegis
of the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM).
Before ACM&rsquo;s Special Interest Group on Programming
Languages (SIGPLAN) changed its bylaws in 1972
to permit the creation of technical committees,
and the subsequent formation in 1973 of STAPL
(SIGPLAN Technical Committee on APL),
there was only an APL Committee existing under the 
SHARE Interactive Systems Project.</p>

<p>It all began in 1968 when APL was released by IBM
as a Type III (contributed) program in the SHARE library.
When the APL Committee was organized at the winter meeting
of SHARE in Los Angeles, Garth Foster of Syracuse University
offered to edit and distribute a &ldquo;modest newsletter&rdquo;
to provide a means of communication.
He named this circular <i>SHARE*APL\360</i>
and expressed the hope that &ldquo;SHARE would be
raised to the power of APL\360&rdquo;.
We should note two aspects of Foster&rsquo;s initial attitude:
1) he was thinking about the <i>power</i><tt> * </tt>
of APL, and
2) he printed 100 copies of the first newsletter,
although he mailed out all of about 35.</p>

<p>The modest publication which began with an equally modest circulation
culminated four years later in Volume III, Number 5 which enjoyed
a distribution of 400-500 copies.
What started out as an informal newsletter eventually became
the &ldquo;voice of APL&rdquo; when STAPL was formed and assumed
the responsibility for publishing <i>APL Quote-Quad</i>
for an organized APL community.
<i>APL Quote-Quad &mdash; The Early Years</i> is 
a collection of the first 14 issues, 
many of which are no longer available.
This anthology is rich in APL history &mdash;
particularly from a user&rsquo;s point of view.
These informal papers provide a capsule history
of the early struggles of the APL community
to share information, to get organized,
and to provide a formalized forum for APL.</p>

<p>Foster&rsquo;s paper, &ldquo;The APL User Community &mdash;
Its Roots&rdquo;
(<i>APL Users Meeting Proceedings, Toronto, October 6, 7, 8, 1980</i>
Sponsored by I.P. Sharp Associates Limited)
documents in considerable detail how 
<i>SHARE*APL\360</i> evolved into <i>APL Quote-Quad</i>
as well as the events that were taking place at the time.
Not included, are some behind-the-scenes anecdotes
which deserve attention in order to understand
what it took to produce the first 14 newsletters.
For example, it is probably not widely known that an anonymous
benefactor donated $100 in response to the editor&rsquo;s 
plea for &ldquo;interest, support and contributions&rdquo;
in the very first issue!</p>

<p>The sheer mechanics of printing and distributing 
a newsletter containing terminal output generated on 
devices in considerable need of adjustment presented a
tremendous challenge to Foster and subsequent editors,
A.T. McEwan and D.W.A. Watson of Lakehead University,
Thunder Bay, Ontario.
Contributors frequently supplied material in a form which
could not be reproduced even in the loose format
of the newsletter.
Retyping these contributions often introduced errors
which managed to get into print.
And, there were problems, too, with reproducing 
APL expressions and functions: 
the light italic APL font would consistently break up
during the multilith process used to print the newsletters.</p>

<p>The general production scheme observed in those early years
involved the editors reviewing contributions,
writing editorials and producing camera-ready copy.
The newsletters were printed by staff
in the Engineering Department at Syracuse University.
The early mailing list was maintained on an APL system,
and address labels were printed out on terminals 
with pinfeed platens.
Work-study students at Syracuse helped to assemble
the newsletters while Garth Foster and his family
pasted the labels on each copy by hand.</p>

<p>As with any volunteer effort, certain details
of bookkeeping managed to fall through the cracks.
Foster remembers that batches of letters requesting
newsletters, address changes and other information
disappeared by dint of turnovers in secretarial help
and just plain oversight.
Tracking down and correcting errors of omission
was frustrating and time-consuming.</p>

<p>The survival of the original publishing effort
owes a lot to the dogged efforts of the first editors.
It took considerable dedication to APL for Foster,
McEwan and Watson to continue publishing with few
resources and consequent &ldquo;production disasters&rdquo;.
Nowadays, Garth is willing to reveal the chagrin he felt
when meeting the president of I.P. Sharp Associates Ltd.
for the first time.
It seems that Ian Sharp seized the occasion to casually
mention that his name was not spelled with
an &ldquo;e&rdquo;at the end of it,
a practice <i>APL Quote-Quad</i> had been faithfully
observing for a number of issues.</p>

<p>In addition to the usual problems involved in
publishing any periodical,
the editors of the early newsletters also endured
the agonies of editorial decisions and the frustrations
connected with trying to provide truly informative
content for a community starved for information.
This is revealed in a comment in the editorial 
in Volume III, Number 1, June 11, 1971,
&ldquo;Surely Larry Breed is not the only person
prepared to reply to queries on APL?&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, all was not grim in those early years,
and one gets an insight into the sense of humor
which still abounds in the APL world.
The Great Inner Products Contest was announced
in the January 15, 1971 issue.
Readers were encouraged to submit their
&ldquo;favorite and most expressive use
of the inner product&rdquo;.
Among the so-called rules of the competition:</p>

<table><tr><td width=28 nowrap>&nbsp;</td><td>
<p>The entry<tt> +.× </tt>is not permitted except
by management and APL salesmen.</p>

<p>Explaining<tt> ×.+ </tt>places you in a special
category.</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Volume II, Number 6, March 17, 1971 reveals that
the APL community could meet challenge with characteristic
tongue-in-cheek:</p>

<table><tr><td width=28 nowrap>&nbsp;</td><td>
<p>The most interesting [entry] was from Roger Moore,
I.P. Sharp Associates, Toronto, who points out that
the &ldquo;new improved&rdquo; 5732-XM6 or 5736-XM6
executing<tt> ⍴B∧.=⍉B←500&nbsp;1⍴1 </tt>in a CLEAR WS
produces a register dump and a SYSTEM ERROR.
He suggested that a call to the QUEND macro 
be inserted immediately after card 5272 of
APLSVDOP in order to &ldquo;destroy&rdquo;
his interesting inner product entry. 
His Post Script that another call to the QUEND
macro after card 3712 in the same assembly fixes
the bug encountered when something like<tt> ∧/125000&nbsp;1⍴1 </tt>
is attempted.  (Way to go IBM!)</p>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Not all was fun and games, however.
Mike Jenkins introduced the new matrix inversion primitive,
domino, to the APL community in Volume III, Number 4,
February 10, 1972.  This landmark paper is often referred to,
and can still be used today to gain insight into this function.
And domino can be used in interesting and mysterious ways, too.
At the [APL82] meeting in Heidelberg, Timo Seppälä of TMT-Team Oy,
Helsinki, was asking people if they knew the shortest expression 
for computing the average of a vector.
(Think about it and then look for the answer at the end
of this introduction.)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a testimony to his early belief in the &ldquo;power&rdquo;
of APL that Garth Foster <i>still</i> gets queries about 
<i>APL Quote-Quad</i> though he has not been officially 
involved with its publication since 1972.</p>

<p>APL PRESS takes pleasure in reprinting these first 14 newsletters
which provided a valuable service to the APL community.
We must remember that these volunteer efforts offered
the only means of written communication for APL users
in the &ldquo;old days&rdquo;.
In addition, these informal papers continue to contribute
something even more worthwhile to APL as it exists today:
the contain the only written summaries of the early 
APL conferences and workshops which took place 
in the days before proceedings were published
as a matter of course.</p>

<p>APL PRESS is grateful to G.H. Foster, A.T. McEwan and
D.W.A. Watson for permission to reprint these issues.
We also thank Larry Breed (IBM), Garth Foster and
Gene McDonnell (I.P. Sharp Associates, Inc.)
for making their personal collections available
for reproduction.</p>

<p>Congratulations to Dr. Kenneth E. Iverson for receiving
the 1975 Harry Goode Memorial Award &ldquo;in recognition
of the generalized notation, <i>APL</i>, which he conceived
and developed; of the effectiveness in communications which
has resulted from the use of <i>APL</i> 
in many diverse applications;
and of the expected impact that <i>APL</i> will have
on programming language theory and practice 
in the future.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In presenting the award, the American Federation of
Information Processing Societies characterized
Dr. Iverson in the following way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Educator, scientist, mathematician, and author
or coauthor of over 30 published books and articles,
Dr. Kenneth Iverson has demonstrated throughout his career
a level of performance worthy 
of the highest respect and admiration.
The computing profession is truly indebted to Dr. Iverson.</p>

<p>For more than twenty years, Dr. Iverson 
has played a key role in the furtherance of computer science and,
in particular, was responsible for devising <i>APL</i> &mdash;
a major data processing language which has led 
to new directions in programming.
In addition, Dr. Iverson has contributed to the development of more
effective and convenient systems for interactive computing
and has been instrumental in developing a unifying conception
of the role of executable languages.</p>

<p>The seed of <i>APL</i> goes back to 1957 
when Dr. Kenneth Iverson was an Assistant Professor
at Harvard University,
lecturing in mathematics and computer science.
At this time, he contributed a paper on
<a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/DFSP.htm">
&ldquo;Description of Finite Sequential Processes&rdquo;</a>
as part of a study of switching theory
undertaken by Harvard for the Bell Laboratories.
This paper included notational conventions combining
contributions from set theory, algebra, and logic
in a precursor of the form subsequently
developed as <i>APL</i>.</p>

<p>Dr. Iverson received a great deal of support
and encouragement in his efforts from Professor
Howard H. Aiken, Director Emeritus of the 
Harvard Computational Laboratory,
who was the receipient of the first 
Harry Goode Award in 1964.
By 1962 the notation had aroused considerable
interest and he published his book entitled
<a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/papers/APL.htm">
&ldquo;A Programming Language&rdquo;</a>.
From this, the acronym <i>APL</i> developed.</p>

<p>By 1960, Dr. Iverson joined the Computer Science Department
of the Thomas J. Watson Research Center of IBM
in Yorktown Heights, New York,
where he continued to explore applications
of the notation and began the development of <i>APL</i>
as a formal programming language and a computing system.
The first time-shared implementation &mdash; <i>APL</i>\360 &mdash;
was released for public use in 1967.</p>

<p>In 1970, Dr. Iverson was named IBM Fellow.
His work at this time centered in several disciplines,
including collaborative projects in circuit theory,
genetics, geology, and calculus.
Further efforts included the preparation of an
algebra text and collaboration on developments
of <i>APL</i> systems leading to broad use
for large-scale data base and commercial applications.</p>

<p>Currently, Dr. Iverson serves as an IBM Fellow and
Manager of the <i>APL</i> Design Group in Philadelphia
where he is working on extensions of <i>APL</i>
to general arrays and other language developments.</p>

<p>Dr. Iverson received his B.A. degree in Mathematics
from Queen&rsquo;s University, Kingston, Canada in 1950;
his M.A. degree in Mathematics from Harvard in 1951;
and in 1954 he received his Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics
from Harvard.
He presently resides in Swarthmore, Pennsylvania and is a
member of the Canadian Mathematical Congress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Iverson expressed a particular sense of honor
in receiving the Harry Goode Memorial Award
because the man who originally introduced Dr. Iverson
to computing, Professor Aiken of Harvard,
was the first individual to ever received this award.</p>

<p>Dr. Iverson also commented that it was unfortunate
the award could only be presented to a single
individual because there were others who have contributed
greatly to the development of <i>APL</i>.</p>

<p>Our warmest congratulations on receiving an award
richly deserved.<br>&nbsp;</p>

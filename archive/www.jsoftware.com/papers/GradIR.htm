<p>The large-scale digital computer was first conceived and built
solely for the purpose of scientific computation.
In the short space of ten years since the completion 
of the first computer,
these machines have reached such a high state of development that
universities need no longer concern themselves with
the scientific computer as a subject of research.
For example, when our chairman, Dr. Jacobson,
required a computer, he wisely procured a suitable unit
without embarking on an extensive development program.</p>

<p>At the same time, educational programs in numerical analysis
and the use of computers have been developed to fill the needs of 
scientific computation.  Without in any way minimizing the continuing
importance of such programs,
I should like to point out that their pattern 
is now fairly well established, and furthermore,
that there are solid reasons for relegating
a considerable part of this work to the undergraduate level.
For these reasons I wish to exclude consideration
of scientific computers and computation
and confine my attention to the educational needs 
arising out of new applications of automatic computers.</p>

<p>The development of the scientific computer has stimulated 
great public interest in applications which go far beyond
those originally foreseen.
Examples of these applications are familiar to all of us
and range from business accounting and the control 
of industrial processes to language translation
and the automatic compilation of concordances.
Industry is applying the computer to a great variety of jobs,
including payroll accounting, customer accounting,
and automatic inventory control.
A pioneer example of the latter application is furnished here
in Detroit by the J.L. Hudson Company.</p>

<p>It is, of course, the need for processing data which is common
to all of these applications and which makes computer techniques
valuable to each of them.
In principle the scientific computer is capable of filling the needs
of any such application. 
However, in most cases a great deal of investigation is required 
to discover practical ways of applying computer techniques,
and present progress in this direction is slow
and unsatisfactory to all concerned.</p>

<p>There are many who would disagree that the present rate 
of progress is unsatisfactory.
In fact, there is a school of thought which appears to hold
the position that the scientific computer, 
or some small modification thereof, 
is a satisfactory tool for nearly all applications,
and that all that remains to be done is to train
any army of programmers to apply existing equipment
to the jobs at hand.</p>

<p>It is possible that this attitude is correct.
In order to establish this, however,
it will be necessary to evaluate carefully 
the possibilities of machines designed specifically
for each particular type of job.
This is a task which should be undertaken promptly,
but it will require the attention of persons
having a much better educational preparation
than that required for programming.</p>

<p>The reasons for the slow progress are apparent.
On the one hand, those who could profitably use
automatic computing equipment in their work have 
accumulated a vast experience in the present practices
of data processing but possess little or no knowledge
of the capabilities and limitations of automatic devices.
On the other hand, engineers with the necessary knowledge
of computers lack knowledge of the special fields
of application.
There is, in short, a scarcity of individuals 
possessing experience and training 
in all of the disciplines involved.</p>

<p>There are presently three distinct efforts being made to correct
this situation.  They are:</p>

<p>1. Cooperation between members of the several disciplines;</p>

<p>2. Short term courses in computers offered to operating
personnel in the field of application;</p>

<p>3. Professional education on a graduate level.</p>

<p>All of us take part in the first of these efforts,
through personal contacts and conferences,
and many give assistance in short term courses such
as the one just concluding here at Wayne.<sup><a href="GradIR.htm#notea">[a]</a></sup>
These efforts have been and will continue to be
extremely valuable in providing the operating personnel required.
Nevertheless, cooperation between members of several disciplines
cannot hope to match the single individual with a mastery
of all the disciplines involved,
and short term courses cannot be expected to produce
individuals with the fresh outlook required 
for significant advances in a difficult field.
Only by professional education on a graduate level
can we expect to develop people who will approach
the subject from a research point of view
and provide the leadership required.</p>

<p>Although it promises rich returns on a long-range basis,
the third effort has unfortunately received the least attention.
Because it has received so little attention to date,
opinions as to the content of a graduate program
are still in formation.
Rather than attempt a survey of such opinion,
I plan to present a single viewpoint, 
as embodied in the graduate program
in data processing to be instituted in Harvard
in the coming year.</p>

<p>Although the program was conceived in the Division of Applied Science,
it was quickly recognized that such a task could not be undertaken
by engineers alone. 
Accordingly, the cooperation of the Department of Economics
and of the Graduate School of Business Admininstration was enlisted.
It is firmly believed that close cooperation between groups
of this nature is essential to the success of any such program.</p>

<p>The master&rsquo;s degree program will follow the normal
pattern at Harvard, requiring eight half-courses and no thesis,
and usually will be completed in one year.
The recommended program consists of the following courses:</p>

<p>1. Two half-courses in data processing.
The first half-course is concerned with the use of computer
techniques in the storage and handling of information,
with applications to automatic record keeping and automatic
control of industrial processes.
Topics will include the representation of information,
problems of access to information,
a systematic treatment of the problems of sorting,
logic and switching theory.
Machine programming will also be discussed
and illustrated by demonstration problems 
on a large-scale computer.</p>

<p>The second half-course will be devoted to the organization
of data processing systems and case studies of existing systems.
These courses will be presented jointly 
by a faculty member of the Division of Applied Science 
and a faculty member of the Business School.</p>

<p>2. Two half-courses in electronic control and calculating circuits.
The first half-course deals with timing circuits and pulse
techniques with illustrations drawn from a number of applications.
The second half-course deals with timing circuits and associated
apparatus applicable to modern data processing equipment.</p>

<p>3. One half-course in accounting.
This course is designed to acquaint the student with 
internal accounting control in business enterprises.
Methods of cost accounting, inventory control,
wage accounting, and distribution cost accounting
are among the topics covered.
This course will be presented by 
a faculty member of the Department of Economics.</p>

<p>4. One half-course in operations research.
Operations research is one of the most promising tools recently
made available to management, and in discussing its place 
in the present program it will be helpful to
distinguish between certain functions of management.
One obvious function is the direct control 
of office operations.
If office work is viewed as a routine job of information handling,
there appears to be no more reason for management
to take a direct interest in the details of office operation
than in the engineering details of other production line operations.
Nevertheless, because the office serves as the channel through
which management operates,
as well as the prime source of information,
a direct interest in office operations has always been necessary.
The mechanization of offices operations by the application
of computer techniques may simplify 
the problems of management in this area but will have
no direct effect on the second and more essential function
of management, namely, the effective scheduling 
of interrelated activities.</p>

<p>It is in this area of scheduling interrelated activities
that operations research is of value.
The projected course will be presented by a member of
the Department of Economics.
Topics covered will include input-output economic analysis,
theory of games, and linear programming.</p>

<p>5. One half-course in machine components.
This course is a survey of the various storage and switching
devices finding application in data processing systems.
</p>

<p>6. One half-course in statistics.  There should be no need
to establish the importance of statistics in data handling operations.
Nevertheless, the following comments may be in order.
In assessing the requirements of data processing systems,
it often appears that the collection of the required 
statistical information looms rather large in point 
of equipment required.
For this reason a careful look at the possibility of
using carefully chosen samples rather than a 100 per cent
coverage may be very rewarding.</p>

<p>It will be noted that courses in numerical analysis 
have been omitted from the foregoing program.
This is not to imply that work in scientific computation
is no longer of importance, but rather that such courses
have now become established and that the new program is oriented
toward business applications.
Courses in numerical analysis are, of course, available and
may be elected instead of some of the recommended courses.</p>

<p>Especially on a graduate level the variations
of background preparation require the possibility 
of substituting other courses for some 
in the recommended program.
In addition, courses in the theory of switching,
servo-mechanisms, and analog computers will also be available.</p>

<p>While the normal program will emphasize applications
to business operations, other specialities will be recognized.
For example, a specialist in the field will lecture
on the problem of automatic language translation.
The automatic processing of information of a continuous nature
such as is encountered in the control of industrial processes
will also be considered.</p>

<p>An essential part of such a program is the provision
of facilities for research.
These facilities include two large-scale computers,
well-furnished scientific libraries, and the extensive facilities
of the Business School library.</p>

<p>Especially in the field of accounting are we fully aware
that this type of endeavor has no precedent 
on a graduate level.
The need for constant research by the instruction staff
is especially great in a new field which has little 
or no literature.
Accordingly, strong research programs must be 
established and should serve the stimulate 
the interest of students.</p>

<p>At present, a detailed study of any one of a number
of business applications presents a challenging field of research.
Until general principles begin to emerge, 
each type of business application will present a unique problem,
and it is doubtful whether the art will mature as rapidly 
as was the case with scientific computers.</p>

<p>One result of research should be a continued improvement
in the course program itself, and several years may be expected
to elapse before a stable and satisfactory solution is reached.
Nevertheless, in view of the urgent needs which were pointed up
by earlier speakers, it is clear that a start must be made
as soon as possible.<p>
